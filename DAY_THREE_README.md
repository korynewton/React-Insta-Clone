## Day III

### Focus (Day III)

- Be able to explain and implement a React Higher Order Component to conditionally render protected content to the screen.

### Daily Setup (Day III)

- To start off today, your application should still be structured like yesterday, but now it should have a working search bar, comment input, and like icon.
- Those aren't necessary, however, for what you will be doing today. You can still work on today's part of this project even if you aren't completely done with yesterday's portion.

### Description (Day III)

- Today you will be building a "Higher Order Component" (HOC)
- The HOC will not let users see the posts until they have logged in. (Our login system for this will be faked using LocalStorage).
- The job of the HOC will be to render a login page if the user is not logged in, then render the posts after the user is logged in.

#### Tasks (Day III)

- Create a `<PostsPage />` component in your `components/PostsContainer` directory.

  - You'll have to move a lot of what is rendered in `app.js` to this new component
  - In app.js, render the `PostsPage` component.
  - Make sure the app working as it was before since it has been re-factored now.
  - This is to ensure that we clean up our App component a little bit before we re-factor it to be wrapped up in an HOC

- Building the High Order Component

  - Create a directory called `authentication`
  - Inside that directory create a HOC called `authenticate`. This is where all of the magic is going to happen.
  - This component should be able to take in a component as an argument, and it will return a `class` component.
  - Inside of `authenticate's` render method, you'll want to return the Component that gets passed into it.
  - Be sure to export out this component.
  - Head over to App.js and `import` in our new `authenticate` Higher Order Component and pass in `App`.
  - If this worked right then everything should render as it used to.
  - Authenticate will look a lot like this when you're done setting it up.

```js
const authenticate = App =>
  class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <App />;
    }
  };
```

- Build out the LoginPage component. You can design it how you like

  - In your `components` directory, create a directory called `Login` and add a new file called `Login.js`.
  - There should be a `username` input, a `password` input, and a `Login` button.
  - The component should invoke the `login` function in `Login.js` when a user logs in.
  - This login function should set a `username` on `localStorage`. You'll need to check local storage to see if a user is logged in.
  - Be sure to force the page to reload when a user logs in so that our component un-mounts and mounts again.

- Extending the functionality of the HOC to conditionally render the `LoginPage` or the `App`

  - First, we need to change our `authenticate` HOC to return a second function that will take in a second component (which will be the `LoginPage`). This will look like a "double arrow" function - `const authenticate = App => LoginPage => {}`.
  - In `App.js`, the component that is exported is the class component that our HOC returns. So invoke the HOC function twice (which is called currying) on the export line. The first time it's invoked, pass in `App`. The second time, pass in `LoginPage` (which you'll need to import here). ie - `export default higherOrderComp(FirstComponent)(SecondComponent)`
  - Inside of the class component that the inner function in `authenticate` returns, we need to add a constructor to hold our state data.
  - On state we need a user `loggedIn` boolean flag.
  - On `componentDidMount` we need to check `localStorage` to see if a user is logged in.
  - Inside of the render function we will check `if a user is logged in`
  - If a user is logged in we will return the `<App />`, else we will return the `<LoginPage>`

#### Stretch Problems (Day III)

- Now that you have a user set in `localStorage`, go ahead and use that `username` when a user posts a comment to make it so the logged in user is the one commenting on the posts.
- Styled-Components

  - Watch this video about [styled-components](https://youtu.be/bIK2NwoK9xk) in its entirety.
  - Head over to the [Styled-Components docs](https://www.styled-components.com/) and learn about the library.
  - Once you feel like you've got a good grasp of this concept, go ahead and start converting your components into styled-components.
  - Try and make this thing as beautiful as possible

- Deploy your Instagram clone to netlify and share it in the #show-it-off channel.
